<h2>About</h2>
<p>
NomadBSD is a persistent live system for USB flash drives, based on
FreeBSD<sup>®</sup>. Together with automatic hardware detection and setup, it
is configured to be used as a desktop system that works out of the box, but
can also be used for data recovery, for educational purposes, or to test
FreeBSD<sup>®</sup>'s hardware compatibility.
</p>
For a list of installed software packages see the
<a href="download/nomadbsd-1.3.manifest">MANIFEST file</a>.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
The images for 64-bit and 32-bit computers fit on a 4GB USB flash drive.
The 64-bit Mac<sup>®</sup> image requires 5GB. A system with a 1.2GHz CPU and 1G of RAM
should be able to run NomadBSD decently. Booting is possible via BIOS and UEFI.
</p>
<h2>Current Version</h2>

We are pleased to present the release of NomadBSD 1.3.
<h4>Changes since 1.2</h4>
<ul>
<li>
The base system has been changed to FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE-p1
</li>
<li>
Due to a deadlock problem, FreeBSD's unionfs has been replaced by
<a href="https://github.com/rpodgorny/unionfs-fuse">unionfs-fuse</a>
</li>
<li>
The GPT layout has been changed to MBR. This prevents problems with Lenovo
systems that refuse to boot from GPT if "lenovofix" is not set, and systems
that hang on boot if "lenovofix" is set.
</li>
<li>
Support for ZFS installations has been added to the NomadBSD installer.
</li>
<li>
The rc-script for setting up the network interfaces has been fixed and improved.
Support for setting the country code for the wlan device has been added.
</li>
<li>
Auto configuration for running in VirtualBox has been added.
</li>
<li>
A check for the default display has been added to the graphics
configuration scripts. This fixes problems where users with Optimus have
their NVIDIA card disabled, and use the integrated graphics chip instead.
</li>
<li>
NVIDIA driver version 440 has been added.
</li>
<li>
nomadbsd-dmconfig, a Qt tool for selecting the display manager theme, setting
the default user and autologin has been added.
</li>
<li>
nomadbsd-adduser, a Qt tool for added preconfigured user accounts to the system
has been added.
</li>
<li>
Martin Orszulik added Czech translations to the setup and installation wizard.
</li>
<li>
The NomadBSD logo, designed by Ian Grindley, has been changed.
</li>
<li>
Support for localized error messages has been added.
</li>
<li>
Support for localizing the password prompts has been added.
</li>
<li>
Some templates for starting other DEs have been added to <span class="mono">~/.xinitrc</span>.
</li>
<li>
The interfaces of nomadbsd-setup-gui and nomadbsd-install-gui have been improved.
</li>
<li>
A script that helps users to configure a multihead systems has been
added.
</li>
<li>
The Xorg driver for newer Intel GPUs has been changed from <span class="mono">"intel"</span>
to <span class="mono">"modesetting"</span>.
</li>
<li>
/proc has been added to <span class="mono">/etc/fstab</span>
</li>
<li>
A D-Bus session issue has been fixed which prevented thunar from accessing
samba shares.
</li>
<li>
DSBBg which allows users to change and manage wallpapers has been added.
</li>
<li>
The latest version of update_obmenu now supports auto-updating the Openbox menu.
Manually updating the Openbox menu after packet (de)installation is therefore no longer needed.
</li>
<li>
Support for multiple keyboard layouts has been added.
</li>
<li>
www/palemoon has been removed.
</li>
<li>
mail/thunderbird has been removed.

We are pleased to announce the release of NomadBSD 1.2! We would like to
thank all the testers who sent us feedback and bug reports.
<h4>Changes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The base system has been upgraded to FreeBSD 12.0-p3</li>
	<li>TRIM has been enabled by default.</li>
	<li>A <span class="mono">vt(4)</span> color theme has been added.</li>
	<li>The <span class="mono">dialog(1)</span> based setup has been replaced
	by a Qt GUI which supports dynamic translation. Currently available
	translations are German and Russian.</li>
	<li>In order to reduce the number of implicit package upgrades and
	possible inconsistencies, the <span class="mono">pkg(8)</span> default
	repository has been changed to "Quarterly".</li>
	<li>A recent copy of the NomadBSD handbooklet has been added to nomad's
	home dir.</li>
	<li>A new option has been added to the boot menu which allows users to set
	<span class="mono">hw.syscons.disable</span>.</li>
	<li>The kernel tunable
	<span class="mono">vfs.root_mount_always_wait=1</span> has been added to
	/boot/loader.conf to prevent mountroot from mounting the root partition
	before the device is available.</li>
	<li>Dynamic creation of configuration files for Intel GPUs has been added.
	For GPUs using the legacy i915kms driver, the UXA acceleration method is
	used. For newer GPUs SNA is used which fixes performance problems (at
	least on HD Graphics 5500 (Broadwell))</li>
	<li>The backend for compton has been changed to xrender. This fixes input
	delay problems with the NVIDIA driver. Further, it makes using compton
	with VESA and SCFB possible.</li>
	<li>x11/dmenu has been added which can be started by pressing Ctrl+Space.</li>
	<li>A bug where the NVIDIA GLX libraries could not be found because of
	path changes in the nvdia-driver-{304,340,390} packages has been fixed.</li>
	<li>A bug where executing <span class="mono">pkg install</span>/
	<span class="mono">delete</span> lead to overwriting the
	library path to the NVIDIA libraries has been fixed.</li>
	<li>A <span class="mono">dialog(1)</span> menu has been added to the
	<span class="mono">initgfx</span> script which allows the
	user to choose between auto detection and a non-accelerated graphics
	driver.</li>
	<li>The detection of network devices has been improved.</i>
	<li>A script with a Qt5 frontend for installing NomadBSD on a hard
	disk has been added.</li>
	<li>Support for building 32bit images has been added.</li>
	<li>The user interface has been slightly changed.</li>
	<li>Support for the local keymap when entering the geli password has been added.</li>
	<li>Support for resetting NomadBSD has been added. Users can execute
		<pre class="code">/usr/libexec/nomad/nomad_setup reset</pre> in
		single user mode to bring NomadBSD back to its initial state.
	</li>
	<li>Localized XDG standard dirs have been added.</li>
	<li>The swap partition has been removed.</li>
	<li>linux_base has been removed.</li>
