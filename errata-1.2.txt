NomadBSD 1.2 Errata

Problem
     Due to a rc dependency problem, the rc-script for configuring the network
     devices runs after the device driver loading daemon. This prevents  auto-
     configuration of some network devices.

Solution
     Download setup_netif [1], and copy it to /etc/rc.d:

          # fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomadbsd/NomadBSD/master/config/etc/rc.d/setup_netifs
          # cp setup_netifs /etc/rc.d

     If you can't access the internet from NomadBSD:
          Download  the  file and put it on a FAT, NTFS, or Ext2/3/4 formatted
          USB thumb drive. Boot NomadBSD, mount the thumb drive, and copy  the
          file to /etc/rc.d/

          If you have a FreeBSD system with internet access, you can of course
          copy the file directly to your NomadBSD USB flash drive:

               # fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nomadbsd/NomadBSD/master/config/etc/rc.d/setup_netifs
               # mount /dev/gpt/nomadroot /mnt
               # cp setup_netifs /mnt/etc/rc.d
               # umount /mnt
